# AladdinBots
Here is the repo for my bots, there are mainly 2 of them 

1) Link To Database .py
  You need to make sure that facebook_keywords_api is running properly, have the VPN as well working, and fill ZakRequest.txt with the links you want.
  They are line seperated for every link
  
2) Get Comments Bot .py
  This bot is designed to run on a vm, in the main class, it accepts the customer ID, and grabs all latest comments.
